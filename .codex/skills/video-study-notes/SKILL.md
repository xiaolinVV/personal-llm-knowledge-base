description: Download and preserve learning videos, subtitles, metadata, keyframes, comments, and companion links/code repositories, then turn them into structured Chinese study notes with Mermaid diagrams. Use when Codex needs to process YouTube or other yt-dlp-supported learning videos, update a watchlist with a finished-note link, create video companion notes, extract transcript/comment insights, find GitHub or other code links, or preserve process diagrams from video frames.

# Video Study Notes

Use this skill to turn one learning video into durable project knowledge: local media assets plus a readable Chinese note.

## Workflow

1. Locate the source URL.
   - If the user points to a watchlist, read it and pick the named video.
   - Preserve the original video URL in the final note.

2. Capture local assets.
   - Prefer the helper script:

     ```bash
     python3 .codex/skills/video-study-notes/scripts/video_study_assets.py capture \
       'VIDEO_URL' \
       --slug 'YYYY-MM-DD-channel-topic'
     ```

   - The script saves assets under `local-media/youtube/<slug>/`, which should stay ignored by Git.
   - If terminal access to YouTube needs a local proxy, the script auto-detects macOS system proxy settings. Override with `--proxy http://127.0.0.1:PORT` or disable with `--proxy none`.
   - Comments are captured by default with `--comments-limit 200`; use `--skip-comments` only when comments are irrelevant or too slow.
   - If assets already exist, use `--skip-download` to regenerate transcripts, comments, manifests, and keyframes without downloading again.

3. Read only the needed generated files.
   - Start with `asset-manifest.md`.
   - Use `transcript-clean.txt` for content.
   - Use `chapter-transcript.md` for timeline structure.
   - Use `comments-digest.md` for pinned comments, code links, author clarifications, and high-signal audience feedback.
   - Inspect `frames/contact-keyframes.jpg` and selected `frames/frame-*.jpg` when the video includes diagrams, UI flows, or architecture visuals.

4. Write the note in `notes/`.
   - Use `references/note-template.md` as the structure.
   - Name the note from the original video title, lightly refined only when the title is too long or contains awkward filesystem characters.
   - Include local asset paths, source metadata, companion links/code repositories, timeline, core explanation, Mermaid diagrams, engineering caveats, references, and unverified items.
   - Add a `配套资源 / 代码地址` section. Prefer code links extracted in `asset-manifest.md`; include GitHub, Gitee, GitLab, Bitbucket, Hugging Face, project docs, or course materials.
   - Add a `评论区补充` section when comments exist. Prioritize pinned comments, uploader replies, code links, corrections, implementation caveats, and strong conceptual clarifications.
   - If the transcript mentions a repo or source code but no concrete URL is found in metadata/description/comments, say that explicitly instead of inventing a link.
   - Recreate important diagrams as Mermaid instead of relying only on screenshots.
   - Do not paste a long transcript. Summarize and transform.

5. Update the source watchlist when applicable.
   - Add a short `已沉淀` entry linking to the new note.
   - Do not rewrite unrelated watchlist rankings.

## Diagram Rules

- Use Mermaid for repeatable conceptual diagrams: flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state loops, data-flow diagrams.
- Derive diagrams from subtitles plus keyframes. Do not invent architecture that the video does not support.
- When the video shows a process, preserve the process shape:
  - ReAct-style loops become `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram`.
  - Multi-role interactions become `sequenceDiagram`.
  - Planning/replanning loops become `flowchart TD`.

## Accuracy Rules

- Distinguish transcript-derived notes from verified facts.
- For current APIs, SDKs, models, or product behavior, verify against official documentation before stating them as current.
- If example code from the video was not run locally, add it under `未验证事项`.
- For high-risk Agent actions, explicitly mention human review: shell commands, file writes outside a sandbox, database mutations, email, payment, deployment, and account actions.

## Output Standard

A finished run should leave:

- Downloaded video/subtitle/metadata/keyframe assets under `local-media/youtube/<slug>/`.
- Downloaded comments and a comments digest under `local-media/youtube/<slug>/` when comments are available.
- A structured note under `notes/<original-video-title>.md`.
- A watchlist back-link if the video came from a watchlist.
- A clear final response listing paths and what was not verified.
